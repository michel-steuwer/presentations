# Recap from last week: Ownership

- To organise resource and memory management we adopt the concept of *ownership*

- In `C++` we tie the management of a resource to the lifetime of a variable on the stack.<br/>
  The allocation of the resource (e.g. the `malloc` call) is done when we create the variable.<br/>
  The deallocation of the resource (e.g. the `free` call) is done when the variable is destroyed.

.box-80[.fs-80[
```
int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // heap memory is allocated for the numbers
  // use v
} // memory on the heap will be freed automatically
```
]]

- In `C++` this idiom is implemented by `struct` data types with two *member functions* (called methods in Java):
  - The *constructor* which is called when creating values
  - The *destructor* which is called when a variable of this type reaches the end of its lifetime

- `C++` provides common data types for easy and non-leaking memory management:
 - `std::vector` for ownership of multiple values
 - `std::unique_ptr` for unique ownership of a single value
 - `std::share_ptr` for shared ownership of a single value

---
# .fs-90[Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Smart Pointers]

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

struct node {
    const char * value;
    // every node can have multiple outgoing edges
    // a node "owns" the nodes it point to
    // this is a shared ownership as a single node can have multiple nodes pointing to it
    std::vector< std::shared_ptr<node> > edges_to;
    // constructor
    node(const char * v) { value = v; }
    // add a new connection to the DAG
    void add_edge_to(std::shared_ptr<node> n) { edges_to.push_back(n); }
}; // we do not need a custom destructor as the shared_ptr manages its memory automatically

// create a diamond-shaped DAG 
std::shared_ptr<node> create_diamond() {
  std::shared_ptr<node> a = std::make_shared<node>("a");
  a->add_edge_to(std::make_shared<node>("b"));
  a->add_edge_to(std::make_shared<node>("c"));
  std::shared_ptr<node> d = std::make_shared<node>("d");
  a->edges_to[0]->add_edge_to(d);
  a->edges_to[1]->add_edge_to(d);
  return a;
}
```

# Ownership transfer

- When modeling unique ownership we should use a `std::unique_ptr`

- For example we can model a tree where the parent is uniquely responsible for its children like this:

.box-70[.fs-80[
```C
struct node {
    const char * value;
    std::vector< std::unique_ptr<node> > children;

    node(const char * v) { value = v; }
};
```
]]

- When we add a member function to add children we receive an error:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
struct node { /* ... */ void add_child(std::unique_ptr<node> n) { children.push_back(n); } };
```
].fs-80[
```
memory:1805:31: error:
call to implicitly-deleted copy constructor of 'std::__1::unique_ptr<node, std::__1::default_delete<node> >'
```
]]

- What are we trying to achieve here?<br/>
  The ownership should be unique, but if we make a copy of a unique pointer then clearly two variables<br/>
  (the original and the copy) hold ownership. The compiler is preventing that this happens!<br/>
  .center[ Instead we have to explicitly *transfer the ownership*! ]


---
# Ownership transfer with .fs-80[`std::move`]

- To transfer the ownership of a unique resource such as `std::unique_ptr` we use `std::move`:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
void add_child(std::unique_ptr<node> n) { children.push_back(`std::move(n)`); }
```
]]

- The ownership transfer signals that the old variable is no longer responsible to manage the resource:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
void main() {
  std::unique_ptr<node> a_ptr = std::make_unique<node>("a");
    {
      std::unique_ptr<node> b_ptr = std::make_unique<node>("b");
      a_ptr->add_child(`std::move(b_ptr)`); // ownership is transferred here
    } // lifetime of b_ptr ends => nothing happens (b_ptr doesn't own anything anymore)
} // lifetime of a_ptr ends => memory allocated for a and b will be freed
```
]]

- It is forbidden to access the value of a variable for which ownership has been transferred

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
    std::unique_ptr<node> b_ptr = std::make_unique<node>("b");
    a_ptr->add_child(`std::move(b_ptr)`);
    b_ptr->value; // BAD IDEA
```
]]

# Bugs and finding them 

.left-column[
- Software development is not free of errors

- We call these software errors *bugs*

- We will investigate a number of tools to help us identify and understand bugs:
  - **Debuggers**, run a program in a controlled environment where we can investigate its execution

  - **Static analysis** tools, reason about a program's behaviour without running it

  - **Dynamic analysis** tools, add instructions to a program to detect bugs at runtime

# Debugger

- The two popular debuggers for `C/C++` programs `GDB` and `LLDB` are used almost exactly the same

1. We need to compile the program with the .boxed[`-g`] flag which adds debug information into the binary

2. Instead of executing the program normally we start debugger and load the program:
.box-80[.fs-90[
```C
$ ./program arg1 arg2            ; "Run program normally"
$ gdb  --arg ./program arg1 arg2 ; "Load program in GDB debugger"
$ lldb --    ./program arg1 arg2 ; "Load program in LLDB debugger"
```
]]

3. Inside the debugger we start the execution with the .boxed[`run`] command:
.box-80[.fs-90[
```C
(lldb) run
```
]]

- A good list of commands available in the `GDB` and `LLDB` debuggers is available here:<br/> https://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html

- To exit run the .boxed[`quit`] command inside the debugger

---
# Segmentation fault

- This runtime error message is one of the most common in systems programming:

.box-80[.fs-90[
```C
[1]    83437 segmentation fault  ./program
```
]]

- A *segmentation fault* is raised by the hardware notifying the operating system that your program has attempted to access a restricted area of memory

- The operating system will then immediately terminate your program<br/>
  .smaller[In Operating Systems you will learn how it is possible to catch the segmentation fault signal and handle it.]

- The most common examples of programs with segfault are:
  - **Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer**
  - **Writing to read-only memory**
  - **A buffer overflow**, i.e. accessing memory outside of an allocated buffer
  - **A stack overflow**, often triggered by a recursion without a base case

---
# Where did my segmentation fault come from?

- To find the line in a program that triggered the segmentation fault we load it in the debugger and run it:

.box-80[.fs-80[
```C
$ lldb -- ./program 12345
(lldb) run
Process 85058 launched: './program' (x86_64)
2018-10-21 20:56:00.106714+0100 program[85058:12827554] detected buffer overflow
Process 85058 stopped
  ...
```
]]

- The debugger has now stopped the execution.<br/>
  Using the .boxed[`bt`] (*backtrace*) command we investigate the calls leading to the segfault:

.box-80[.fs-80[
```C
(lldb) bt
 * thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal SIGABRT
  * frame #0: 0x00007fff76d1ab86 libsystem_kernel.dylib`__pthread_kill + 10
  ...
    frame #6: 0x00007fff76ca8e84 libsystem_c.dylib`__strcpy_chk + 8
    `frame #7: 0x0000000100000eaf program overflow(argc=2, argv=0x00007ffeefbff300) at program.c:35`
    frame #8: 0x0000000100000efb program`main(argc=2, argv=0x00007ffeefbff3c8) at program.c:42
    frame #9: 0x00007fff76bdc085 libdyld.dylib`start + 1
    frame #10: 0x00007fff76bdc085 libdyld.dylib`start + 1
```
]]

- Here *frame 7* shows us the file (`program.c`) and line (35) which triggered the segfault in our code

---
# Breakpoints and GUI for debugging


- *Breakpoints* are points at which the execution is stopped and we can investigate the state of the execution

- Setting breakpoints in the command line debugger is tedious (but totally possible)

- The `Visual Studio Code` editor (but also others, like Atom) provide a GUI for the `GDB` or `LLDB` debugger

.center[
![:img width: 50%](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/debugging/debugging_hero.png)
]

- Detailed instructions for the configuration can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging

---
# Static Analysis

- A static analysis reasons about the code without executing it

- The compiler performs some static analysis every time you compile your code, e.g. type checking

- It is good practice to enable all warnings (`-Wall`) and make warnings errors (`-Werror`)<br/>
  This way the compiler can be most helpful in detecting bugs before your program is executed

- Some static analysis is too expensive to perform in every build<br/>
  Other static analysis enforces a particular coding guideline

- These type of static analysis is available with special flags or in separate tools

- We are going to use the tools provided by the `clang` compiler

- We invoke the static analyzer using a  flag and specifying the output format of the report:<br/><br/>
  .center[.boxed[`clang --analyze --analyzer-output html program.c`]]

---
# Clang static analyzer report

- The tool generates a report explaining the potential bug

<iframe width="100%" height="60%" src="4.c.report.html"></iframe>

- Here has the tool reported a "garbage value" which in this case leads to undefined outcome for a `if`-branch

---
# `clang-tidy`

- `clang-tidy` is a *linter* .fs-60[(the name comes from the first UNIX tool to perform static analysis on C).]<br/>
  It is invoked like a compiler accepting the same flags as `clang` specified after two dashes: `--`

- A series of *checks* can be en- and disabled. Here we enable the checks for *readability*:

.box-90[.fs-80[
```
$ clang-tidy -checks="readability-*" 6.c -- -Wall -Werror
/Users/michel/Desktop/examples/6.c:2:16: warning: pointer parameter 'p' can be pointer to const
 [readability-non-const-parameter]
void test(int *p) {
          ~~~  ^
          const
/Users/michel/Desktop/examples/6.c:4:9: warning: statement should be inside braces 
 [readability-braces-around-statements]
  if (p)
        ^
         {
```
]]

- We are suggested to put braces around the branch of an `if`-statement and to use `const`

- `clang-tidy` is a flexible tool that allows to enforce coding guidelines and to modernize source code

- It is possible to extend `clang-tidy` by writing your own checks

- Detailed information for `clang-tidy` are available here: http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/


---
# Dynamic Analysis Tools

- There exists a family of bug detection tools which use dynamic analysis

- These tools need the program to run and can only detect bugs which are<br/>
  encountered during the execution of a particular test input

- The `clang` project calls these tools *sanitizers*. The most important are:
  - `AddressSanitizer` - a memory error detector
  - `MemorySanitizer` - a detector of uninitialized reads
  - `LeakSanitizer` - a memory leak detector
  - `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer` - a detector of undefined behaviour

- We will later in the course use:
  - `ThreadSanitizer` - a data race detector

---
# Address Sanitizer

- Address Sanitizer is a memory error detector for detecting:
 - Out-of-bounds accesses
 - Use-after-free
 - Double free

- By enabling this tool `clang` will insert instructions in the program to monitor every single memory access

- This slows down the execution by about 2x. The similar tool `valgrind` has often a slowdown of 20-100x!

- These flags enable address sanitizer:

  .center[.boxed[.fs-80[`clang -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -O1 -g -Wall -Werror program.c -o program`]]]

- The .boxed[`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`] flag produces a readable call stack and `-O1` enables basic optimizations.

- The compiler will produce a binary as usual which we execute: .boxed[.fs-80[`./program`]]

- Address Sanitizer has found [hundreds of bugs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFoundBugs) in large scale software (e.g. Chromium and Firefox)

---
# Address Sanitizer output

- The output reports a `heap-use-after-free on address 0x614000000044` and provides information where the memory was freed (line 5) and allocated (line 4)

.center[
![:img width:80%](images/AddressSanitizer.png)
]

---
# Memory Sanitizer

- Memory sanitizer detects uninitialized reads to memory:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```
% cat umr.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int* a = malloc(sizeof(int)*10);
  a[5] = 0;
  if (a[argc])
    printf("xx\n");
  return 0;
}

% clang -fsanitize=memory -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O2 umr.cc
% ./a.out
WARNING: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value
    #0 0x7f45944b418a in main umr.c:6
    #1 0x7f45938b676c in __libc_start_main libc-start.c:226
```
]]

- This tool is under active development and currently only available for linux 

---
# Leak Sanitizer

- Leak sanitizer detects memory leaks, that is memory which hasn't been freed at the end of the program:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```
$ cat memory-leak.c
#include <stdlib.h>
void *p;
int main() {
  p = malloc(7);
  p = 0; // The memory is leaked here.
  return 0;
}
% clang -fsanitize=address -g memory-leak.c
% ./a.out
==23646==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks
Direct leak of 7 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
    #0 0x4af01b in __interceptor_malloc /projects/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cc:52:3
    #1 0x4da26a in main memory-leak.c:4:7
    #2 0x7f076fd9cec4 in __libc_start_main libc-start.c:287
SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 7 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).
```
]]

- This tool is also under active development and marked as experimental

---
# Undefined Behavior

- What is undefined behaviour?

- For certain operations the C standard demands no particular behaviour.<br/>
  These are typically cases which are considered bugs, e.g. dereferencing a `null` pointer.

- It is expensive to check every time a pointer is dereferenced if the operation is valid.<br/>
  Because the compiler does not have to ensure a particular behaviour for `null` pointers,<br/>
  it can *assume* that the programmer has ensured that the pointer is not `null`.

- Undefined behaviour is therefore crucial for fast code, but makes detection of bugs much harder, as it is not guaranteed that a bug will result in a program crash

- A good introduction to undefined behaviour is this series of blog posts:<br/>
  [What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior](http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html)

---
# Undefined Behavior Sanitizer

- Undefined behavior sanitizer detects various types of undefined behaviour

- Here an integer overflow is detected:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```
% cat intOverflow.c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int k = 0x7fffffff; // this is the largest possible signed int value ...
  k += argc;          // ... this will produce an integer overflow
  return 0;
}

% clang -fsanitize=undefined -Wall -Werror intOverflow.c -o intOverflow

% ./intOverflow
intOverflow.c:3:5: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot
 be represented in type 'int'
```
