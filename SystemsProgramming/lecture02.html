# Overview - Introduction to `C` and Data Types

- Today we are going to discuss fundamental features of `C`

- We will focus on differences to `Java` and `Python` and not discuss every syntactic construct in `C`

- A particular focus lies on the role *data types* play in assisting us to write *meaningful programs*

- We will discuss important fundamental concepts such as:<br/>
    *lexical scope* and *lifetime* of variables, *call-by-value*, or the difference between *declarations* and *definitions*

- We will also discuss the meaning and importance of compiler warnings and errors

- We will explore all of this by writing example `C` programs

# `Java` vs `C`

- We start by looking at some `Java` and equivalent `C` programs

- These are taken from [rosettacode.org](rosettacode.org) which collects programs in many different languages

1. Computation of the Dot Product: `\( z = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} x_i \cdot y_i \)`

--

.left-column[
```Java
public class DotProduct {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] x = { 1,  3, -5};
    double[] y = { 4, -2, -1};

    double z = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      z += x[i] * y[i];
    }
    System.out.println(z);
  }
}
```
]

.right-column[
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double x[] = { 1,  3, -5};
    double y[] = { 4, -2, -1};

    double z = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        z += x[i] * y[i];
    }
    printf("%f\n", z);
}
```

# 2. Calculation of the value of `\(e\)`

- The number `\(e\)` is defined as the infinite series: `\(e = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} =
    \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \ldots  \)`

--

.left-column[
```Java
public class CalculateE {
  public static final double EPSILON
    = 1.0e-15;
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    long fact = 1;
    double e = 2.0;
    int n = 2;
    double e0;
    do {
      e0 = e;
      fact *= n++;
      e += 1.0 / fact;
    } while (Math.abs(e - e0) >= EPSILON);
    System.out.printf("e = %.15f\n", e);
  }
}
```
]

.right-column[
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
    
#define EPSILON 1.0e-15
    
int main() {
  long fact = 1;
  double e = 2.0;
  int n = 2;
  double e0;
  do {
    e0 = e;
    fact *= n++;
    e += 1.0 / fact;
  } while (fabs(e - e0) >= EPSILON);
  printf("e = %.15f\n", e);
}
```

  while( scanf( "%d", &guess ) == 1 ) {
    printf( "Guess what the number is: " );
    if( number == guess ){
      printf( "You got it!\n" );

    }
    printf( "Your guess was too %s.\n",
        number < guess ? "high" : "low" );

# `Java` vs. `C`

- As seen with the examples `Java` and `C` look and feel very similar <br/>
  (when we ignore the object oriented features in Java)

- `Java` has adopted the same syntax style that `C` introduced earlier

- If you know `Java` already you can start writing `C` code straight away!

- We will learn the differences of how `Java` and `C` programs are executed and how memory is organised

- In the rest of this lecture we will look in more depth into `C` and start exploring some differences with `Java`

---
# Compiler warnings and errors

- Always remember: **The compiler is your friend!**

- Errors and warnings are feedback from the compiler that there is something wrong with your program

- A compiler error indicates that it is impossible to compile your program<br/>
  You have to definitely change your program to get it compiling

- A compiler warning indicates an unusual condition that *may* (and quite often do) indicate a problem<br/>
  You should change the program to: *either* fix the problem *or* clarify the code to avoid the warning.

- There is **no good reason to ignore warnings**!

- The .boxed[`-Werror`] flag turns all warnings into errors making it impossible to compile a program with warnings

- The .boxed[`-Wall`] flag enables most compiler warnings

- Every warning and error that is caught by the compiler can not lead to a problem at runtime!

- In this course we insist on using the .boxed[`-Wall -Werror`] flags (particular for your coursework!)


---
# Makefile 101

- `make` is the most popular *build system* for `C` programs automating the process of compiling programs

- Alternative build systems are: Maven, Bazel, Ninja. There exists much more ...

- For `make` we are writing a `Makefile` which has the following basic structure:

```Makefile
program : source.c
    clang -Wall -Werror source.c -o program
# ^ this space must be a single tab character!
```

- The first two lines form a *rule* which explain how a *target* (in our case: `program`) is build

- The lines below the fist line is the *commands* of the rule and define how the target is build

- After the colon *dependencies* are listed, these are files or other targets which are required to build the target

- Run `make` will execute the first rule of the `Makefile` in the current directory <br/>
  .boxed[`make target`] will execute the rule to make the named target

---
# Entry point for every `C` program - `main`

- Every `C` program has exactly *one* `main` function which is the entry point into the program

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
}
```

- The `main` function is special in the sense that if the terminal `}` is reached .boxed[`0`] is automatically returned

- A return value of .boxed[`0`] indicates a successful execution to the environment executing the program

- A non-negative return value indicates an unsuccessful execution

- Two valid version of `main`:

```
int main()                       { ... }
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... }
```

- The second version allows to process command line arguments<br/>
  We will learn how to understand the signature next week when we learn about pointers

---
# Basic output with `printf`

- `printf` is a function defined in .boxed[`#include <stdio.h>`] and allows a formated printing of values

- The first argument is the *format string* containing special characters indicating the formating of values

- Starting from the second arguments are the values to be printed

- The number and order of special characters and values has to match

.center[
.box-70[
| .smaller[Special Characters] | .smaller[Explanation] &nbsp;| .smaller[Argument Type] |
|:-------:|---------:|----:|
| `%c` | .smaller[single character] &nbsp;| `char` |
| `%s` | .smaller[character string] &nbsp;| string: .smaller[(`char *`)] |
| `%d` | .smaller[signed integer in decimal representation] &nbsp;| `int` |
| `%f` | .smaller[floating-point number in decimal representation] &nbsp;| `float` / `double` |
]
.smaller[Full list of special characters at: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf)]
]

.box-80[
```
printf("%c %s", 'a', "string");        // prints: "a string"
printf("%f - %f = %d", 3.14, 1.14, 2); // prints: "3.140000 - 1.140000 = 2"
```

# Variables

- Variables are syntactically used exactly like in Java, e.g.: .boxed[`int x = 4; x++;`]

- Variable *definitions* contain first the *data type*, then the *name* (or *identifier*) and an *initialization expression*

.box-30[
```C
        int x = 4;
```
]

- Why do we need to declare the data type for every variable?

- Python doesn't require us to define data types:
.box-30[
```Python
x = 4
x = x + 1
```
]

- `C` is a *statically typed* programming language where every expression has to have a data type<br/>
   which is known without running the program

.fs-150[.center[But what are data types for anyway?]]


---
# Representation of values and Data Types

- What is the *meaning* of the following bit-pattern?
.box-30[
```
        1000 0001
```
]

--

- Or more precisely, what *could* this bit-pattern mean?
  - maybe: `129` if we want to represent a unsigned 8-bit long integer value
  - maybe: `-127` if we want to represent a signed 8-bit long integer value with two's complement
  - maybe: `-1` if we want to represent a 8-bit [Minifloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minifloat) value
  - but also maybe it means the color blue? or `129` bananas? ...

- A bit-pattern has no meaning on it's own! We, the human programmers, give bit-patterns meaning!

- By declaring a variable with a *data type* (such as `int`) we decide what the bit-pattern in memory *means*

.center[.fs-150[**Data types give bits meaning!**]<br/> .smaller[(That's why they are so important)]]

---
# Preserving meaning thanks to data types

- To assist us writing *meaningful programs* the compiler enforces that computations<br/>
  *preserve the meaningful representation of our data*

- For example: for `x+1` the compiler ensures that a *meaningful* addition of the value one and `x` is performed.

    When `x` has the data type `char` and the value `42` this will modify the bit-pattern like this:
.box-40[.fs-90[
```
 0010 1010 + 0000 0001 = 0010 1011
```
]]

    When `x` has the data type `float` and the value `42` this will modify the bit-pattern like this:
.box-40[.fs-90[
```
  0 10000100 01010000000000000000000
 + 0 01111111 00000000000000000000000
 ====================================
      0 10000100 01011000000000000000000
```
]]

- By enforcing operations to respect the data types the compiler prevents meaningless computations:
.box-70[.fs-90[
```
error: invalid operands to binary + (have ‘float’ and ‘char *’)
     x = x + "1";
           ^
```
]]

---
# Representation of `C` variables in memory

- Every variable in `C` is stored at a constant location in memory that does not change over its lifetime

- In `C` the data type of a variable determines its representation in memory:

.box-50[
.fs-80[
```
    int x = 42;
    // represented as: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 1010
    float f = 42;
    // represented as: 0100 0010 0010 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```
]]

- By choosing a particular integer data type we are in control how much memory we use!

.box-80[
.fs-75[
| Type name | Typical size in bytes &nbsp;| Value range |
|:-------|---------:|----:|
| `char` / `unsigned char`  | 1 byte &nbsp;| [-127, +127] / [0, 255] |
| `short` / `unsigned short` | 2 bytes &nbsp;| [-32767, +32767] / [0, 65535] |
| `int` / `unsigned int` | 4 bytes &nbsp;| [-2147483647, +2147483647] / [0, 4294967295] |
| `long` / `unsigned long` | 4 or 8 bytes &nbsp;| at least as for `int` |
| `long long` / `unsigned long long` | 8 bytes &nbsp;| [`\(- 2^{63} - 1 \)`, `\(+ 2^{63}-1\)` ] / [0, `\(2^{64}-1\)`] |
]]

- For example to store 1 million temperature measurements in Celsius<br/>
  choosing an array of `char` values over an array of `int` values safes almost 3 MB of data<br/>
  this is almost the entire size of my processors L3 cache!

---
# Boolean values in `C`

- We have now seen multiple data types for representing integer and floating point values

- What about the boolean values `true` and `false`?

- In `C` every integer can be interpreted as a boolean, where .boxed[`0`] represents `false` and any other value `true`:

.box-50[
.left-column[.fs-80[
```C
int i = 5;
while (i) {
    i = i - 1;
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
printf("done\n");
```
]]
.left-column[
&nbsp; &nbsp; prints &nbsp; &nbsp;
]
.left-column[.fs-80[
```
4
3
2
1
0
done
```
]]
]

<div style="clear: both"></div>

- Since the `C99` standard it is also possible to use the .boxed[`#inlude <stdbool.h>`] header:
.box-70[.fs-80[
```C
#inlude <stdbool.h>
int main() { bool a = true; bool b = false; bool c = a && b; printf("%d\n", c); }
```
]]

- In `stdbool.h` `true` and `false` are declared as macros with the values .boxed[`1`] and .boxed[`0`]

---
# Lexical Scoping

- Each pair of curly braces `{ }` is called a `block` in `C` and introduces a *lexical scope*

- Variable names must be unique in the same lexical scope

- For multiple variables with the same name, the variable declared in the innermost scope is used.<br/>
  Which values will be printed?

```
int main() {                                  int foo(int i) {
    int i = 5;                                  int j = i;
    {                                           {
        int j = foo(i);                           int j = i + 2;
        printf("%d\n", j);                        printf("%d\n", j);
    }                                           }
}                                               return j + 1;
                                              }
```

--

- First `7` (from inside `foo`) and then `6` (from inside `main`) will be printed

---
# Scoping and preprocessor macros

- Preprocessor macros are dangerous as they don't respect the lexical scoping

- Consider the following macro

```C
#define ADD_A(x) x + a
```

- We could not define a function like this, because `a` is not in the lexical scope of the definition

- If we now apply this macro it will work with what ever `a` is in scope where we *use* the macro:

```C
int add_one(int x) {
    int a = 1;
    return ADD_A(x); // will expand to: return x + a; and compute x + 1
}

int add_two(int x) {
    int a = 2;
    return ADD_A(x); // will expand to: return x + a; and compute x + 2
}
```

- This is called *dynamic scoping* (in contrast to lexical scoping) and should best be avoided!

---
# Variable lifetime

- We have learned that variables are stored at locations in memory that do not change over their lifetimes

- But what is the *lifetime* of a variable? In `C` this depends how the memory for the variable was allocated. There are three cases:
    1. *automatic*: These are all variables declared locally in a block (i.e. inside a pair of `{}`) and their lifetime ends at the end of the block.
        All variables we have seen so far fall into this category.
.fs-80[
```C
int main() {
            int x = 42;
        } // end of the block - end of the lifetime of x
        ```
]

    2. *static*: Variables declared with the `static` keyword or defined at file-level outside all blocks.
        The lifetime is the entire execution of the program.
.fs-80[
```C
int foo() {
            static int count_calls_to_foo = 0; // the variable is initialized only once
            count_calls_to_foo++;
        } // variable continues to life 
        ```
]

    3. *allocated*: These are variables for which we have to explicitly request memory using *dynamic memory allocation* functions (such as `malloc`).
        We manage the lifetime of these variables ourselves.

---
# Stack-based Memory management

- When the lifetime of an *automatically* variable ends its memory location is freed<br/>
  and can be reused by other variables

- This memory management happens fully automatically as it is very easy to implement:
  - every time a block is entered put aside a location in memory for every variable declared in the block
  - every time a block is exited free the locations in memory for every variable declared in the block

- As this memory management strategy added and removes memory locations in a last-in-first-out manner we call this *stack-based memory management* and the area of memory managed in this way *the stack*

- We will learn in the next two week the other important area of memory called the *heap* which is manged manually by the programmer


---
# Structs

- So far we have only seen variables with basic types<br/>
  There are two important types which combine multiple elements: `arrays` and `structs`

- A `struct` consists of a sequence of *members* of (potentially) different types:
.box-50[.fs-90[
    ```C
struct point {
      int x;
      int y;
    };

    int main() {
        struct point p = {1, 2};
        printf("x = %d\ny = %d\n", p.x, p.y);
    }
    ```
]]

- The members are accessed like public class members in `Java` using the `.` notation

- The members are stored next to each other in memory in the same order as defined in the `struct`

- The type of a `struct` is written .boxed[`struct name`], but we often use this trick to shorten it:
```
typedef struct { int x; int y; } point; int main() { point p = {1, 2}; /* ... */ }
```

---
# Arrays

- Arrays consist of a multiple elements of the same type:
.box-60[
    ```C
int main() {
        int x[2] = {1, 2};
        printf("x[0] = %d\nx[1] = %d\n", x[0], x[1]);
    }
    ```
]

- Arrays which are stored on the stack must have a fixed size (so that the memory is automatically managed)

- We will learn how to use arrays for which the size can change next week

- The elements on an array are stored next to each other in memory


---
# Strings and Characters

- Strings in `C` are represented as arrays of characters
```C
char greeting[] = "Hello World";
```
  is the same as
```C
char greeting[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\0'};
```

- We use double quotes .boxed[`"`] to write a (ASCII) string literal and single quotes .boxed[`'`] to write a character literal

- Strings in C are terminated by the special character .boxed[`'\0'`] that is added automatically for string literals

- To print a string with `printf` we use the .boxed[`%s`] formation character
```C
printf("%s\n", greeting);
```

- If we forget the terminating .boxed[`'\0'`] character this will print the content of the memory<br/>
  until it hits the next bit pattern equivalent of .boxed[`'\0'`]!

---
# Functions

- Functions are probably *the most important* abstraction mechanism in computing science<br/>
  They allow us to write code in a modular fashion which we can then reuse

- A *function definition* in `C` looks like this:
.box-60[.fs-90[
    ```C
int max(int lhs, int rhs) {
        if (lhs > rhs) { return lhs; } else { return rhs; }
    }
    ```
]]

- The *return type* specifies the data type of the value that will be returned after evaluating the function<br/>
  If a function returns no value the special type `void` is used as return type

- The *name* which should describe the behaviour of the function

- A *parameter list* which specifies the data type and name of each parameter expected by the function

- The *function body* which is a block containing the code executed when calling the function

- To call a function we provide an *argument* for each parameter and process the return value

.box-40[.fs-90[
```C
            int x = max(5, 3);

# Declaration vs. Definition

- A function definition (as seen on the previous slide) fully specifies the behaviour of the function

- A *function declaration* only specifies the interface describing how a function can be used:
.box-40[.fs-90[
```C
      int max(int lhs, int rhs);
```
]]

- Function declarations are important for writing modular software as it allows to separate the<br/>
  interface (the declaration) from the implementation (the definition)

- For calling a function (e.g. `max` or `printf`) the compiler checks that the data types of the call expression and the function declaration match:

.box-90[.fs-90[
```C
int max(int lhs, int rhs);
int main() { int x = max(4.5, 'b'); }
```
]
.fs-80[
```
max.c:6:17: error: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 4.5 to 4 [-Werror,-Wliteral-conversion]
    int x = max(4.5, 'b');
            ~~~ ^~~
```
]]

- The linker searches for the definition which might be in a different file or library (as for `printf`)

---
# Call-by-value

- When we call a function how are the arguments passed to it? <br/>
  E.g. what happens to a variable which is passed to a function which modifies its parameters inside its body?

.box-80[.fs-90[
```C
void set_to_zero(int x) { x = 0; }

int main() {
    int y = 42;
    set_to_zero(y);
    printf("%d\n", y); // what will be printed?
}
```
]]

--

- The value `42` will be printed, because when we call a function we pass *a copy of the arguments* to it

- That means `x` and `y` in the example above are stored at different locations in the memory<br/>
  When `set_to_zero` is called the value of `y` is copied into the memory location of `x`

- We call this *call-by-value* as the argument value is evaluated and stored in the parameter variable
.box-80[.fs-90[
```C
void foo(int x)
int main() { foo( 5 + 4 ); /* first evaluate 5 + 4 to 9 and then store it in x */ }
```
]]

# Call-by-value - Structs and Arrays

- Functions can accept structs and arrays as parameters:

.fs-90[
```
typedef struct { int x; int y; } point;

int search(point needle, point haystack[], int haystack_size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < haystack_size; i++) {
        point candidate = haystack[i];
        if (needle.x == candidate.x && needle.y == candidate.y) { return i; }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
]

- `structs` behave like the basic types and are passed-by-value<br/>
  Changes to the `structs` members are therefore not visible outside the function

- `arrays` are treated slightly specially:
    - instead of copying the array (which would be expensive) the *address of the first element* is passed
    - because of this changes to the `array` elements **are** now visible outside the function

- The special treatment of `arrays` will make more sense when we learn about *pointers* next week

---
# Next week

- Next week we are going to deepen our understanding of memory

- We will learn what *pointers* are and why they are fundamental in understanding `C` and memory

- We will learn the first steps of using dynamic memory allocation on the heap using `malloc`
