# What is (computer) memory?

From the Oxford English Dictionary:

**memory** | ˈmɛm(ə)ri |

noun

1. the faculty by which the mind stores and remembers information

2. something remembered from the past

3. *the part of a computer in which data or program instructions can be stored for retrieval.*

# How should we think about memory?

.center[
![:img width: 70%](images/RobotMemory.png)<br/>
We can think of memory as a sorting cabinet where each box stores the value of a variable<br/>
The variable name is the *label* which allows us to remember where we stored what
]


---
# How should we think about memory?

We can also think of memory as a single long street (called *memory lane*) where each house has a unique *address* 

We have some notion of *spacial locality*:<br/>
Houses close to each other are neighbours, but there are also houses far away at the other end of memory lane<br/><br/>
Spacial locality is an important property exploited by *caches* .smaller[(separated fast but small memories)]

# Computer Memory in Programming

- We can think of memory as a very large one-dimensional array (or a large buffer)<br/>
  where instead of indices into the array we use names to identify variables

- These two programs behave exactly the same:

.box-70[
```C
int main() {                  int main() {
                                int memory[3];
  int x = 42;                   memory[0] = 42;
  int y = 23;                   memory[1] = 23;
  int z = x * y;                memory[2] = memory[0] * memory[1];
}                             }
```
]

<br/><br/>

- Obviously, arrays only store elements of the same type where memory stores variables of different types


---
# Byte Addressable Memory

- Every *byte* (a collection of 8 bits) in memory has it's own *address*

- On a 64-bit architecture these addresses are 64-bit (or 8 bytes) long

- That means a 64-bit architecture can address (in theory) up to `\( 2^{64} \)` bytes = 16 exabytes

- In practice `x86-64` only uses the lower 48 bits of an address, supporting up to `\( 2^{48}\)` bytes = 256 TB<br/><br/><br/>

- To modify a single bit we always have to load and store an entire byte:

.box-70[
```C
int main() {
  unsigned char byte = 0;
  byte = byte | (1 << 3); // set the 3rd bit to 1
  printf("%d\n", byte);   // prints 8 (== 2^3)
}
```
]

---
# Variables in memory

- As we have learned last week:<br/>
  every variable in `C` is stored at a constant location in memory that does not change over its lifetime

- The location of a variable identifiable by it's *address*

- Depending on the size of the data type the value of the variables will span multiple bytes in memory

- We can ask the address of a variable in `C` using the ** *address-of* operator `&`**:

.box-70[
```C
int main() {
  int x = 42;
  int y = 23;
  printf("&x = %p\n", &x); // print the address of x
  printf("&y = %p\n", &y); // print the address of y
}
```
]

- We can ask the size of a variable using the `sizeof` operator:<br/>
  In the example .boxed[`sizeof(x)`] prints .boxed[`4`] as an `int` value is represented by 4 bytes

---
# Pointers

- We can store the address of a variable as the value of *another variable* that we call a *pointer*

.box-80[
```C
int main() {
  int x = 42;
  int * pointer_to_x = &x; // this is a pointer referring to x
  printf("value of pointer_to_x: %p\n", pointer_to_x); // prints 0x77...
```
]

- The ** *dereference operator* `*` ** allows us to access the value of the variable we are pointing to:

.box-80[
```C
  printf("value of x: %d\n", *pointer_to_x); // prints 42
}
```
]

- A pointer to a variable of data type .boxed[`t`] has the data type .boxed[`t *`]

- Every pointer has the same size (independent of the type it's pointing to) because it stores an address

- Pointers on a 64-bit architecture are 8 bytes (or 64 bits)

---
# Pointers are normal variables

- A pointer is a variable like any other, that means:

- The pointer is stored at its own location

.box-70[
```C
  int x = 42;     // stored at 0x7ffeedbed3dc
  int * ptr = &x; // stored at 0x7ffeedbed3d0
```
]

- We can take the address of where the pointer is stored using the address operator:

.box-70[
```C
  printf("%p\n", &ptr); // prints 0x7ffeedbed3d0
```
]

- We can store the address of a pointer in another pointer:

.box-70[
```C
  int * * ptr_to_ptr = &ptr; // stored at 0x7ffeed7ed3c8
```
]

- We can change were a pointer points to:

.box-70[
```C
  int y = 23; // stored at 0x7ffeebaf23c4
  ptr = &y;
```
]

---
# Pointers and `Null`

- Sometimes there is no meaningful value for a pointer at a certain time

- We use the value .boxed[`0`] or the macro .boxed[`NULL`] to represent a pointer that points to *nothing*

- `NULL` often represents an erroneous state, e.g. that an element wasn't found in an array:

.box-90[
```C
// return pointer to value found in array
// return NULL if value not found in array
float* search(float needle, float haystack[], int haystack_size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < haystack_size; i++)
        if (needle == haystack[i]) { return &haystack[i]; }
    return NULL;
}
```
]

- Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer will crash your program!<br/>
  This has led to many software bugs and their inventer Tony Hoare has called it his *billion-dollar mistake*

---
# Pointers and `const`

- In `C` every variable can be annotated with the *type qualifier* `const` to indicate that the content of the variable can not be changed

- This is enforced by the compiler:

.fs-80[
```
  const_error.c:4:6: error: cannot assign to variable 'pi' with const-qualified type 'const float'
  pi = 2.5;
  ~~ ^
const_error.c:3:15: note: variable 'pi' declared const here
  const float pi = 3.14;
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~
```
]

- Pointers can be `const`, i.e. unmodifiable, in three ways:
  1. The *pointer itself*, i.e. the address, can not be changed: .boxed[`float * const ptr;`]
  
  2. The *value we are pointing to* can not be changed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .boxed[`const float * ptr;`]

  3. *Both* value and pointer can not be changed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .boxed[`const float * const ptr;`]


---
# Linked List with pointers and `structs`

- Pointers and `struct`s are useful in building data structures, as example we look at a (single) linked list

- A linked list contains of *node*s with a *value* and a *pointer to the next node*:

.box-60[
```C
   struct node { char value; struct node * next; };
```
]

- The last node in the list has a next-pointer to `NULL`

.box-60[
```C
int main() {
  struct node c = {'c', NULL};
  struct node b = {'b', &c};
  struct node a = {'a', &b};
```
]

- We use a pointer to iterate over the linked list:

.box-60[
```C
  struct node * ptr = &a;
  while (ptr) {
    printf("%d\n", (*ptr).value);
    ptr = (*ptr).next;
  }
}
```
]

---
# Binary (Search) Tree

.box-60[.fs-90[
```C
struct node {
  char value;
  struct node * left_child;
  struct node * right_child;
};
```
]]

- If we keep the binary tree ordered (thus it forms a *binary search tree*) we can search efficiently in it:

.box-60[.fs-90[
```C
node * find(char value , node * root) {
  if (value == root->value) {
    return root;
  }
  if (value < root->value && root->left_child != NULL) {
    return find(value, root->left_child);
  }
  if (value > root->value && root->right_child != NULL) {
    return find(value, root->right_child);
  }
  return NULL;
}
```
]]

- .boxed[`s_ptr->m`] is a notation to access member `m` of a `struct`-pointer `s_ptr`
  and is equivalent to .boxed[`(*s_ptr).m`]


---
# Arrays in Memory

- Last week we have seen one- and two-dimensional arrays:

.box-60[
```C
      int vector[6]    = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
      int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
```
]

- `vector` and `matrix` in the example are both stored exactly the same in memory:

.box-80[
![:img width: 17%](images/vector_in_memory.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![:img width: 45%](images/matrix_in_memory.png)
]

- The two-dimensional array is stored in a *row major* format (i.e. rows are stored after another)

---
class: safe-space
# Pointers and Arrays

- Pointers and arrays are closely related

- The name of an array refers to the *address of the first element* when assigned to a pointer variable:

.box-80[
```C
int vector[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
int * ptr = vector; // this is equivalent to: int * ptr = &(vector[0]);
```
]

 - We can use the array indexing notation on pointers:

.box-80[
```C
printf("5th element: %d\n", ptr[4]); // prints "5th element: 5"
```
]

- Two important differences:

 - `sizeof` returns different values (size of array vs. size of pointer):

 .box-80[
```C
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(vector)); // prints '24' (== 6 * 4 bytes)
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(ptr));    // prints '8'  (size of a pointer)
```
]

 - we can not change `vector`, only its elements:

.box-80[
```C
vector = another_vector; // error: array type 'int [6]' is not assignable
```
]

---
# Pointer Arithmetic

- We can use *pointer arithmetic* to modify the value of a pointer. We can:

  1. Add and subtract integer values to/from a pointer
  2. subtract two pointers from each other
  3. compare pointers

.box-60[.fs-80[
```C
int vector[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

int * ptr = vector; // start at the beginning
  while (ptr <= &(vector[5])) {
    printf("%d ", *ptr); // print the element in the array
    ptr++; // go to the next element
}
```
]]

- Pointer arithmetic takes into account the size of the type the pointer is pointing to:

.box-70[.fs-80[
```C
int * i_ptr = &i; char* c_ptr = &c;
i++;    // this adds 4-bytes (sizeof(int)) to the address stored at i_ptr
c += 2; // this adds 2-bytes (2 * sizeof(char)) to the address stored at c_ptr
```
]]

- The expressions .boxed[`ptr[i]`] and .boxed[`*(ptr + i)`] are equivalent

---
# Call-by-value revisited

- We learned last week that arguments are passed *by-value* to functions

- That means that the value of the argument is copied into the parameter variable

- This is also true for pointers

- Arrays are treated specially and a *pointer to the fist element* is copied instead of the entire array

.box-70[
```C
float average(float array[], int size) {
  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { sum += array[i]; }
  return sum / size;
}
```
]

- The array is treated like a pointer, in fact .boxed[`int param[]`] and .boxed[`int * param`] are interchangeable:

.box-70[
```C
float average(float array[], int size);
float average(float * array, int size);
```
]


<!--
  Here the value of `snd` is copied into `ptr` when calling `print_next`, the change of `ptr` remains local to the function

```C
void print_next(int * ptr) { ptr++; if (ptr) { printf("%d\n", *ptr); } }

int main() {
  int array[6] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int* snd = &(array[2])
  print_next(snd);        // this will print '3'
  printf("%d\n", *snd);   // this will print '2'
}
```
  -->

---
# `main` function with command line argument

- This allows us to understand the definition of the `main` function that processes command line arguments

.box-50[
```
  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... }
```
]

- The `argc` argument specifies the number of command line arguments

- The `argv` argument specifies an array of the command line arguments as strings

  - A single string is represented as an array of characters: .boxed[`char *`]

  - The type of `argv` .boxed[`char \* []`] can also be written .boxed[`char \* \*`]

.box-60[
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
  // print every command line argument
  for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
    printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
}
```
]

---
# Writing Generic Code with `void *`

- Sometimes we want to write code in a generic way so that it works will all data types<br/>
  e.g. swapping two variables or sorting algorithms 

- To swap two variables `x` and `y` of arbitrary type we copy all bytes at the location of `x` to `y` and vise-versa

- For this we write a function .boxed[`swap`] that takes two pointers and number of bytes that have to be swapped:

.box-40[.fs-90[
```C
  void swap(void *x, void *y, size_t l) {
    char *a = x, *b = y, tmp;
    while(l--) {
       tmp  = *a;
       *a++ = *b;
       *b++ = c; }
  }
```
]]

- The special pointer of type .boxed[`void *`] is a generic pointer. Every pointer is automatically convertible to it

.center[
A `void`-pointer only serves as an address pointing to *something*.<br/>
We can not access the value we are pointing to as we don't know what those bits mean.<br/>
**Dereferencing a `void` pointer is forbidden.**
]

# Stack vs. Heap as memory regions

.left-column[
- So far we have only seen variables with *automatic* lifetime managed by the compiler

- These variables are stored in a part of memory that is called the .bigger[*stack*]
 
- The size of every variable on the stack has to be known statically, i.e. without executing the program

- For many important use cases we don't know the size of a variable statically, e.g. dynamically sized arrays

- For such cases we manage the memory manually by dynamically requesting and freeing memory

- The part of the memory used for dynamic memory allocation is called the .bigger[*heap*]

- Stack and heap share the same address space and grow with use towards each other
]

.right-column[.center[
![:img width: 75%](images/stack-heap.png)<br/>
.smaller[stack and heap are in<br/> a single address space]
]]

---
# Dynamic memory management

- We request a new chunk of memory from the heap using the .boxed[`malloc`] function:

.box-70[
```C
      void* malloc( size_t size ); // defined in <stdlib.h>
```
]

- We specify the number of bytes we like to allocate

- If `malloc` succeeds a `void`-pointer to the first byte of the uninitialised memory is returned

- If `malloc` fails a `NULL` pointer is returned

<br/>

- Memory allocated with `malloc` must be manually deallocated by calling `free` (exactly once):

.box-70[
```C
      void free( void* ptr ); // defined in <stdlib.h>
```
]

- If `free` is not called we *leak* the allocated memory

---
# Dynamically sized array example

- We use `malloc` to implement dynamically sized arrays

- Here the size of the `array` depends on the first number entered by the user

.box-70[.fs-90[
```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("How many numbers do you want to average?\n");
  int count;
  if (scanf("%d", &count) == EOF) { exit(-1); }
  // allocate memory based on dynamic input (here its size)
  int* array = malloc(count * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    int number;
    if (scanf("%d", &number) == EOF) { exit(-1); }
    array[i] = number;
  }

  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) { sum += array[i]; }
  printf("The average is %.2f\n", sum / count);
  free(array); // free the memory manually after use
}
```
]]

---
# Linked list extended example

- Using `malloc` we are now able to define functions for creating, extending, and freeing lists:

.box-70[.fs-90[
```C
struct node { char value; struct node * next; }; // same as before

struct node* create_node(char value) {
  struct node * node_ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  node_ptr->value = value; node_ptr->next  = NULL;
  return node_ptr;
}

void add_node_to_list(struct node* list, struct node* node) {
  if (!list) return;
  while (list->next) { list = list->next; }
  list->next = node;
}

void free_list(struct node* list) {
  if (!list) return;
  while (list->next) {
    struct node* head = list;
    list = list->next;
    free(head);
  }
}
```
]]

---
# Returning a pointer to a local variable

- It is an easy mistake to return a pointer to a local variable. Never do it!

- Why?

--

- By returning a pointer to a local variable the pointer has a longer lifetime than the variable its pointing to

.box-80[
```C
struct node* create_node(char value) {
  struct node node;
  node.value = value; node.next  = NULL;
  return &node;
} // lifetime of node ends here ... but its address lives on in a_ptr

int main() {
  struct node* a_ptr = create_node('a');
  // ...
} // lifetime of a_ptr (pointing to node) ends here
```
]


<br/>
.center[** Never return a pointer to a local variable from a function! **]

---
# Function Pointers

- Memory does not store data but also program code. It is possible to have a pointer pointing to code!

- These pointers are called *function pointers* and have the type: .boxed[`return_type (*)(argument_types)`]

- A common use case is passing functions as arguments to other functions:

.box-70[.fs-90[
```C
// defined in <stdlib.h>
void qsort( void *ptr, size_t count, size_t size,
            int (*comp)(const void *, const void *) );

// defined in qsort_example.c
int compare(void* fst, void* snd) { /* ... */ };
int main() {
  // ...
  qsort(array, array_length, sizeof(array[0]), compare);
  // ...
}
```
]]

- Here `compare` is passed as argument to `qsort` and assigned to the function pointer `comp` in line 3

- Function names are automatically converted to function pointers, so that we do not have to write .boxed[`&compare`]

---
# Generic Quicksort

- `qsort` in `C` is written generically so that it can sort data of any data type

- `compare` takes two `void`-pointers and returns a negative integer if the first argument is *less than* the second, a positive integer if it is *greater than* and zero if they are equal

- `compare` has to *cast* (i.e. convert) the pointers into a concrete pointer type before dereferencing them:

.box-60[.fs-90[
```C
int compare(const void* fst, const void* snd) {
  const float* f_fst = fst; const float * f_snd = snd;
  return *f_fst - *f_snd;
}
```
]]

- This is a good example of the use of a `void`-pointer:<br/>
  when passing the pointers `fst` and `snd` around in `qsort` these are addresses pointing *somewhere*<br/>
  inside of `compare` we first have to give meaning to the bits we are pointing to<br/>
  before we are able to make a meaningful comparison

---
# Next week

- We are going to look at **resource management** and **ownership**

- We will particular focus on **memory management**

- We will learn a technique in **`C++`** that assists ownership-based resource management
